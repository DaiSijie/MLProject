# MLProject

In this project, we implement the Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Network (LSTM RN) machine learning algorithm described in the paper ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/L-IEEE.pdf. And we test it against some Context Free Languages (CFL) and Context Sensitive Language (CSL).

This project is part of the course: Introduction to machine learning 600.475 at Johns Hopkins University.
